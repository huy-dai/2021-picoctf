## Insp3ct0r
Points: 50

The purpose of this challenge is to teach us to use the "Inspect Page Source" or "Inspect Element" tool. The flag is broken into three parts: the main page, the CSS page, and the JS page.

## Scavenger Hunt
Points: 50

This problem is framed similar to the Insp3ct0r challenge. The flag is divided into multiple parts, which we find in:

1. The main page
2. The CSS page
3. The Javascript page (which contains a hint)
4. robots.txt - this file tells search engine crawler which pages it can access on our website
5. .htaccess - along with .htpasswd, these files are used for managing user access for an Apache server
6. .DS_Store - short for Desktop Services Store, this an invisible file on the macOS operating system that gets automatically created anytime you look into a folder with ‘Finder.’ 

Despite the hint telling us not to, we could have used a directory searcher to automate the process of uncovering hidden files on the website. Specifically, I used `dirsearch` (link: https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch), and got the following result:
